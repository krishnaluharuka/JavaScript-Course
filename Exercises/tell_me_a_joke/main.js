`A lost dog strays into a jungle. A lion sees the dog from a distance and cautiously thinks, “Hmm, this guy looks edible. Never seen his kind before.”
The lion starts rushing toward the dog menacingly. The dog notices and begins to panic, but just as he’s about to run, he spots some bones nearby. Thinking quickly, the dog loudly exclaims, “Mmm… that was some good lion meat!”
Hearing this, the lion abruptly stops in his tracks and thinks, “Whoa! This guy seems tougher than he looks. I better leave while I still can.” The lion retreats cautiously.
Up in the treetops, a monkey witnesses the entire scene. Realizing he could gain favor with the lion, the monkey decides to spill the truth. He swings down and tells the lion what really happened. Furious, the lion growls, “Get on my back! We’ll deal with him together!”
The lion and monkey rush back toward the dog. Spotting them, the dog panics again but quickly comes up with another idea. He shouts loudly, “Where the hell is that monkey? I told him to bring me another lion an hour ago!”`,

Carl is in the 10th year of a life sentence when he gets a new cellmate, Jim.
After sizing Jim up and deciding he can trust him, Carl shares his grand plan to escape.
“You see,” Carl begins, “for the first five years I was in here, I trained my digestive system to follow my command. Now, I can eat something, and it comes out broken down into its components.”
Jim looks skeptical but intrigued.
Carl continues, “For the last five years, I’ve been swallowing pieces of my uniform. It’s perfect because the guards just think it’s rats chewing on it.”
Confused but curious, Jim asks, “Well, what does that have to do with me? How can I help?”
Carl explains, “The pieces of fabric come out as individual fibers. By this time next year, I figure we’ll have enough to fashion a rope to climb over the wall. I just need you to tie the fibers together.”
Jim, thoroughly disgusted, exclaims, “You have got to be kidding me!”

`As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop, he notices a $10 bill and a note in the dog’s mouth that reads: “5 lamb chops, please.”
Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog’s mouth, and quickly closes up shop to follow him.
He watches in awe as the dog waits for a green light, looks both ways, and trots across the road to a bus stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, the dog walks to the front, inspects the bus number, and hops on.
Dumbstruck, the butcher boards too, following the dog as the bus travels to the suburbs. After a while, the dog stands on his back legs, pushes the “stop” bell, and gets off. The butcher follows closely.
The dog runs up to a house, drops the bag of lamb chops on the doorstep, and backs up. He takes a big run and whap! slams into the door. No answer.
The dog repeats the process—slamming into the door several times—then jumps on a wall, circles the garden, beats his head against a window, and jumps back down, waiting at the door.
Finally, a big guy opens the door and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.
The butcher, furious, runs up and yells, “What the hell are you doing? This dog is a genius!”
The owner replies, “Genius, my ass… it’s the second time this week he’s forgotten his keys!”`,

The C.E.O says “I’ll be a waiter. All you do is carry food back and forth. This’ll be a breeze” so he is teleported to a restaurant. After about an hour, all the annoying customers drive him insane, so he smashes his plates on the ground and gives up.

`There was an old man who lived in a forest. As he grew older and older, he started losing his hair, until one day, on his deathbed, he was completely bald. That day, he called his children to a meeting.
He said, “Look at my hair. It used to be so magnificent, but it’s completely gone now. My hair can’t be saved. But look outside at the forest. It’s such a lovely forest with so many trees, but sooner or later they’ll all be cut down and this forest will look as bald as my hair.”
“What I want you to do…” the man continued. “Is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. Tell your descendants to do the same. It shall be our family’s duty to keep this forest strong.”
So they did.
Each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them.
And for centuries, the forest remained as lush and pretty as it once was, all because of one man and his re-seeding heirline.`,
